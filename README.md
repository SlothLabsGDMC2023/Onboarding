# SlothLab - Box-Split Grammar & Settlement Generator! 

Welcome to the Boxâ€‘Split Grammar system and Settlement Generator! This guide will walk you from zero to contributing structures using our Box-Split Grammar in the Amulet world editor.

The concepts and grammar system we use are based on the work presented in [**Instant Architecture in Minecraft using Box-Split Grammars** by Markus Eger (FDG '22)](https://slothlab.info/assets/pdf/eger2022fdg.pdf). We highly recommend reading this paper first to get an overview!
